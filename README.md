## Cybersecurity ontology for Smart Devices (Semantic Web Technologies)

This ontology is called a sensor network ontology for a smart home. It is a basic simulation for home use for systems such as Home Appliances, Heating systems and Security systems. All devices are connected to communicate and there is a main system control (master node).

### SEMANTIC WEB

The structured architecture that enables applications to share information across many domains, with a focus on business and government systems. The focus of web semantic systems is on the framework for resource description (RDF), which incorporates XML applications of URI types.

#### The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Services in the Smart Household

IoT describes a prospect where a wide range of sensory devices and objects surrounding, like sensors, RFID tags, placement amenities, and portable devices, will be linked to the Internet, allowing these artifacts and gadgets to interact, work cooperatively, and interact in socioeconomic, ecological, and user contexts to accomplish project goals.

- Cloud hosting is used to alter home care and applications inside the smart home arena. While more home systems from multiple retailers are outfitted with the on components that can connect to the Internet, innovative approaches for combining advanced home routers, associated devices, on- board components in home devices, household routers, and cloud computing for developing beautiful clouds have emerged.

#### Cloud Architecture Model with Multiple Layers for IoT-based Home Automation

With an ever-increasing number of data outlets in home automation, organized numerous sensor systems and control processor architectures attached via numerous wireless equipment, the primary problem comprises of accumulating, incorporating, and handling the massive amount of data generated by such sources in order to convert it into the knowledge required by smart services offered in the modern home.

### Ontology Model for Smart Home devices

The numerous different ontology modeling approach is used in the process of modeling data security ontology. This technique may be used to create a multi-level integration framework that can solve the challenges of ontology reuse and shared vocabulary.
The home automation ontology is organized around a set of associated ideas derived from the smart house scenario but unrelated to any specific technology. The concepts are categorized into many degrees of abstractions, resulting in a hierarchical framework. Toward the best knowledge of the researcher, the capabilities supplied in the home automation scenario.
This ontology is called a sensor network ontology for a smart home. It is a basic simulation for home use for systems such as Home Appliances, Heating systems and Security systems. All devices are connected to communicate and there is a main system control (master node).

\*\*The main classes
Main Entity: a generic class for the physical items which is subdivided into the ontology Architecture and Devices.
Sensor: a subclass of the architecture for sensing.

The Device class has three systems which are All Rooms, Fridge and PC. The Architecture is made of 3 individuals; Heating, Lighting and security systems

\*\*Object Properties include
connectedSystems: shows the relationship between a Device and Architecture
observedAttribute: displays which attributes is observed
observes: the relationship between a sensor and an attribute that the sensor observes
onDevice: relationship between a system; like an example a Sensor and a device.
remarkedBy: show the relationship between a remark and a Sensor
attributeOf: shows the relationship between the Architecture and the Device

\*\*Data Properties include
remarkValue: displays the value that the sensor generated
hasType: a property unit.
Mode: displays which mode is applied to the device
Low/High Safety: describes the max and min limits of the expected value for a Sensor

The project summarizes and describes the basic ontology scheme of a Smart home security Ontology using device sensory application process. The project was design using a software called Protege using OWL, RDFS, RDF, RDF GRAPH executing SPARQL queries to collect and manipulate data.
