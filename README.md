##Cybersecurity ontology for Smart Devices (Semantic Web Technologies)

This ontology is called a sensor network ontology for a smart home. It is a basic simulation for home use for systems such as Home Appliances, Heating systems and Security systems. All devices are connected to communicate and there is a main system control (master node).

##SEMANTIC WEB
The structured architecture that enables applications to share information across many domains, with a focus on business and government systems. The focus of web semantic systems is on the framework for resource description (RDF), which incorporates XML applications of URI types.

**The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Services in the Smart Household
IoT describes a prospect where a wide range of sensory devices and objects surrounding, like sensors, RFID tags, placement amenities, and portable devices, will be linked to the Internet, allowing these artifacts and gadgets to interact, work cooperatively, and interact in socioeconomic, ecological, and user contexts to accomplish project goals.

**Cloud Architecture Model with Multiple Layers for IoT-based Home Automation
With an ever-increasing number of data outlets in home automation, organized numerous sensor systems and control processor architectures attached via numerous wireless equipment, the primary problem comprises of accumulating, incorporating, and handling the massive amount of data generated by such sources in order to convert it into the knowledge required by smart services offered in the modern home.
